I will be speaking at the [Myrtle Beach Computer Security Conference](http://www.computersecurityconference.com/) on [April 15th](http://www.computersecurityconference.com/index.cfm?nextpage=ConferenceSchedule). The title of my presentation is &#8220;Practical Web Application Security,&#8221; and will partially be a rehash of my [post about shared hosting](http://blog.pclewis.com/2010/01/the-dangers-of-shared-hosting/) but with more focus on why the little things matter and less on shared environments.
