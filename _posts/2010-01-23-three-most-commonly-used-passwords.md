> **PHREAK**: Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
  
>  **JOEY**: <tt>love</tt>, <tt>secret</tt>, and uh, <tt>sex</tt>. But not in that order, necessarily, right?
  
>  **CEREAL**: Yeah but don&#8217;t forget <tt>GOD</tt>. System operators love to use <tt>GOD</tt>. It&#8217;s that whole male ego thing.

Analyses of various password leaks:

  * [32 million RockYou passwords (December 2009)](http://www.imperva.com/docs/WP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf)
  * [47,380 phished MySpace passwords (2006), 28,644 phpBB.com mailing list passwords (January 2009), and 40,758 singles.org passwords (February 2009)](http://blog.jimmyr.com/Password_analysis_of_databases_that_were_hacked_28_2009.php)
  * [10,000 phished Hotmail passwords (October 2009)](http://www.acunetix.com/blog/websecuritynews/statistics-from-10000-leaked-hotmail-passwords/)
  * [8,000 Comcast passwords (March 2009)](http://digg.com/security/Passwords_of_8000_Comcast_Customers_Exposed?t=24171960#c24171960)

I think it is interesting that as bad as the passwords in [Hackers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) seem, the passwords people actually use are somehow even worse. Where it&#8217;s allowed, <tt>123456</tt> always takes the number one spot, usually by a huge margin; in the RockYou leak, <tt>123456</tt> was used 4x more than its closest competitor (<tt>12345</tt>).Â When purely numeric password are forbidden, <tt>password</tt> is the clear winner, and continues to take the number one spot as requirements are added.

Require a capital letter? <tt>Password</tt>
  
Number? <tt>password1</tt>
  
Both? <tt>Password1</tt>

The top three I&#8217;d try, without knowing the requirements:

  1. <tt>123456</tt>
  2. <tt>password</tt>
  3. <tt>password1</tt>
