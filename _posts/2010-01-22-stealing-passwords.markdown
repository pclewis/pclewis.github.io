All of the [recent stories](http://www.darkreading.com/database_security/security/app-security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222300588) about [high-profile](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hacked/) sites [storing passwords](http://www.darkreading.com/database_security/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222100081) in plain text makes me feel a little bad for picking on people using [unsalted MD5 hashes](http://blog.pclewis.com/2009/12/sql-injection-and-you/). At least they tried!
