I noticed a Stack Overflow post where some other people were seeing a similar discrepancy (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2225976/ignore-a-path-entry-with-bash-tab-completion), so I glanced at the source and I think I see the source of the confusion:

[c firstline="2533" wraplines="false" title="bashline.c"]static int
name_is_acceptable (name)
     const char *name;
{
  struct ign *p;
  int nlen;

  for (nlen = strlen (name), p = fignore.ignores; p-&gt;val; p++)
    {
      if (nlen &gt; p-&gt;len &amp;&amp; p-&gt;len &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; STREQ (p-&gt;val, &amp;name[nlen - p-&gt;len]))
        return (0);
    }

  return (1);
}[/c]

Note that the length of the path being checked must be greater than the length of the item in FIGNORE. So FIGNORE=.svn will not reject an entry that is just .svn

The catch is that leading path components are considered as part of the name. Example:
<code>% ls &lt;tab&gt;
Breakpoint 1, name_is_acceptable (name=0x71d510 ".svn") at bashline.c:2536</code>

<code>% ls ./&lt;tab&gt;
Breakpoint 1, name_is_acceptable (name=0x73dcb0 "./.svn") at bashline.c:2536</code>

So, FIGNORE=.svn will only ignore the directory .svn when there are leading path components.
