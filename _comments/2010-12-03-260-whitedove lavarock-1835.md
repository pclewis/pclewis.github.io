@Jada Wildcat
How moronic do you have to get. Its this simple, dont use a copybotter, because if you do then you have no complaint against anyone for using CDS ban relay to track you and your alts and ban you. If you have never used a copybotter and get banned by cds then you have a complaint. And as for being proud of griffing sims etc |I think you should grow up a bit dont you?
I expect you are about 15 years old and dont have much going on in your life. I dont sympathise with you at all and as for the idea that content theft is not illegal I think you need to wait till you have left school and read a few more books before you try to tell others what is and isnt the law regarding content theft and intellectual property theft, because I can tell you right now you are very very wrong.
Grow up kid and when you get the balls come and see me.
