Compare now gemini with zf redzone I believe the redzone maker zfire xue is nothing more than a greifer and compared to skills hak is unscrupilous and is in complete mockery of LL TOS
although i agre that gemini may not be guilty of any TOS violation I do believe skills hak is morally bankrupt in this endeavour and is also maybe not breaking TOS but will be seeking advice as to whether they are violating the law - For example - in europe and the USA there is such a thing as data protection laws, I would like to see the evidence they have signed the proper legal documents pertaining to those laws, also is the database registered on a site in the correct name and address of the person running that database - where is the accountability and proof of that accountability and to pcl I am making a request, please pcl will you take on zf redzone and give that a full analysis too?
I trust your evidence in this debate
