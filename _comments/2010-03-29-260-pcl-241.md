There was a viewer exploit there that was patched in 2008, but I am not aware of anything more recent. There may still be bugs there, or exploits elsewhere in the SL viewer, but it is unlikely that CDS abuses any of them and there is no evidence to suggest that they do. Aside from the ParcelMediaUpdate and ParcelMediaCommandMessage, I did not see any unusual simulator messages when I went to a CDS-protected sim.
