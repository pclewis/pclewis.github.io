This works for me if I type the commands in trough ssh or terminal manually, but I can't manage to get a script working. The script seems to start fine and it outputs the exact same thing in the terminal window. But VLC doesn't find anything if I start from script. Could you please paste a script that would work?

I pasted this (with the right IP) in an executable file called "vlc-stream":
#!/bin/sh
gst-launch v4l2camsrc device=/dev/video0 ! \
           dsph264enc ! \
           rtph264pay ! \
           udpsink host=192.168.0.100 port=5434
