LOL no CDS doesnt worry me as I have never used a non LL viewer apart from Metabolt, I posted it here as it was brought up on the blog and this blog seems to be looking at the system in a drama free way :) although I did smile when I saw Tesco's stores in the UK had taken action as they were using the Tesco's stores address details for the domain :)

I hope that your sensible and drama free discussions here continue as they are a breath of fresh air :)
