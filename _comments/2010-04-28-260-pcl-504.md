The link you posted does not suggest that CDS is doing something nefarious; I am not sure how it is relevant to anything. In any case, good luck with your tests. I would advise against haphazardly using "illegal" third-party viewers, as some have been demonstrated to contain malware. You also risk running into trouble with LL as the <a href="http://secondlife.com/corporate/tpv.php" rel="nofollow">new third-party viewer policy</a> goes into effect in a few days.
