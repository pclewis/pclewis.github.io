It may be detecting your alts by IP address (which <a href="http://gemini-cybernetics.net/CDS/faq/index.html" rel="nofollow">the CDS faq</a> denies), or by some other method like the ETag on the image someone else mentioned. It could also just be misidentifying the viewer you are using as a "dangerous" one - you may want to <a href="http://appeals.gemini-cybernetics.net/" rel="nofollow">file an appeal</a> with them to see if you can find out.
