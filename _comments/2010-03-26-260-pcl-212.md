It would appear so, but only if you were able to forge the message signature (videoid). The signature could be something simple like llMD5String(SECRET + uuid + avatar + sim, time), or it may not even be an MD5 hash at all. You would also need to control the User-Agent header, so it would not be possible with an LSL script as far as I know.

However, at least at the time of writing the article, you can ban anyone who has posted their full request URL by replaying the request with a "bad" User-Agent.
