I have yet to see any test where the following occurs
1) TP into a sim where there is gemini cds using something like neillife
2) get banned
3) using a different viewer log in with a different account 
4) tp to the same sim
there !!! any video showing this that has no editing in it would dispell the rumours I have looked there is none

Incidentally – just because someone says theres no wolf at the door it dont mean theres no wolf at the door – actuall proof is required. I am attempting to emulate your tests and will do the test i suggested earlier. I am no fool and I am no liar. I do not know if this system is a hacking device or not but I have yet to see ultimate proof that it isnt
