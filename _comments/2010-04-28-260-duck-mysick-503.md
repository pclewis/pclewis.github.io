Sorry in my previous comment i actually meant to post this

 but my tests so far are actually proving you are correct - i would like to say I err heavily on the side of skepticism in any tests i do and am pleased either way to be proven right or wrong, because what matters for me is the truth . My tests so far have mimicked some of what you have done but I am worried about using a copybot system to go further and see what will happen when i use it. I dont want to get branded as a copybotter I have never used one before but I really need to get to the bottom of which side of the story is the truth as my concern is simply privacy rights - as I said before your evidence is holding up quite well and I am not even reluctant to say so. I am glad you are right thus far
