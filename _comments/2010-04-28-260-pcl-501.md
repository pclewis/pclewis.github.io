A video like that would not prove or disprove that CDS does anything nefarious. Using Wireshark and GridProxy you can see all the network traffic coming and going from your computer, as well as the decoded packets to and from the SL viewer.

This article analyzes what I saw, the most nefarious aspect being that it potentially associates your IP address with your avatar name. If you want to repeat the tests, please do! If you find something different I'd love to see it. But your dissatisfaction with my results is not "conflicting evidence" and your "ultimate proof" can only come from yourself.

I am deleting your other comment.
