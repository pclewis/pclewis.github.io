I know this is  how it is detecting for sure, my friend also investergated it and found the same thing... 

I have wrote legal disclaimers, and filed internet crime complaints against Skills Hak, As even though he is not accessing my Personal Info without full concent, He is Monitoring data on my PC without my concent, Wherever its my viewer, or private files, Linden Lab has not offically told everyone that this is allowed. And I personally have not accepted any agreements with Skills hak to allow So.

Futhur more CDS/Skills hak is working with JCool, and the emerald team who run Onyx, which is a copybot made off of a few different copybots, which cant detect many, and much copybotted content. CDS has onyx on the allow list, and Onyx is spoofed as emerald viewer, Since emerald is offically on  Linden Labs third party allow list they can easily run onyx with the copybot and slip right past LL's Security.

I DO not permit any security system to send data to my PC without my concent, and I have personally Shut off my media, and removed its functions from my viewer, and recompiled it without these functions to make sure that their systems cannot read my client...

As far as my CDS ban, It was done because I used an illegal viewer in the past, before Linden Lab's new policy went into effect,  Never used it to commit theft, I just prefered it because it worked way better than emerald even does, way much faster. 

Skills Hak does not have an offical Appeal Website which is professionally made, and there is offically no public announcement, or say involving network bans, which is why I will not use CDS at all, is because CDS is an unjust, and unfair system which puts skills and his friends in total control of the entire system, where they can freely add, or ban anyone they like.

The best idea is to give power to the Sim Owners, without networking Bans, is the only fair, and best way to do it.
