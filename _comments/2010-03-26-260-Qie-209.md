Very interesting.  But what about viewers that don't respond to media commands?  Is that where the bots come in?  Or do we now think there aren't any bots, really? 

Also, are we sure it "protects" against the same account on different IP addresses?  That would seem an obvious thing to do--except that it would be absurdly easy to stuff the database with spoofed reports that every account on the grid is running a naughty viewer.
