Alright what could be possible to do with it:

- collect everyone's IP addresses,
- trace an avatar down to its country, even its city,
- log people's alts,
- have this information nicely collected in a database,
- find leaked data on websites or P2P.

IMO that's pretty much enough reasons to stictly forbid that system because noone but the owners knows what is really done in the background.
