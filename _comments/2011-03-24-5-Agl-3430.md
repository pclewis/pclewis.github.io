looks nice!!! guess I'd like that kind of "non-purist" configuration too.

But I'm using Xmonad with a bluetile config. Additionally I'd say that my screen is wide enough for 2 columns but not for 3 (or even 4). So as soon as I got some time on my hands I'll try to figure out how to fit your ideas neatly into bluetile and how to generalice it for a variable number of collumns.

I'll let you know. Thanks for your work.
