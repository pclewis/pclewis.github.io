Hi

I use to stream video from the n900 with gstreamer (gst-launch) and it works very fine. from terminal to terminal and from terminal to vlc.  like this:

n900

gst-launch v4l2src \ ! videoscale ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=320,height=240,framerate=30/1 ! dsph264enc ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=192.168.2.11 port=5000

vlc.sdp

v=0
m=video 5000 RTP/AVP 96
c=in IP4 192.168.2.10
a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000



now i want to stream audio from the internal mircophone to vlc or gst-launch but i could not find out a working code for both, n900 and vlc/gst-launch. i tried several times  with different codes but no
success. 

for example:

n900

gst-launch pulsesrc ! audio/x-raw-int,channels=1,rate=8000 ! mulawenc ! tcpserversink host=192.168.2.10 port=5001


desktop

gst-launch tcpclientsrc host=192.168.2.11 port=5001 ! mulawdec


i dont know much about gstreamer and the documentation is hard to understand for noobs.

did someone here know a working codeline for the n900 to stream
audio from the internal microphone with gst-launch?

and on the other side a working vlc .sdp or gst-launch code ?


best regards
