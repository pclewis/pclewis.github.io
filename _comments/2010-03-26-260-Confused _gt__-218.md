I have been banned on all of my names.  I used an "illegal client" months ago and have had it deleted off of my system for quite some time.  I would be willing to do a desktop share with you and let you watch me create a brand new alt and log in with the regular SL viewer and watch me get banned.  If it doesnt detect alts and only detects people who use "illegal" viewers then why do I continue to get banned?
