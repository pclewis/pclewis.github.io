I get the same ETag no matter what avatar/client info I provide. Also, it's a static file on a shared host, doesn't have an X-Powered-By header (the script does), and matches Apache's normal ETag generation (inode-size-mtime):

<code>Last-Modified: Mon, 15 Mar 2010 16:31:03 GMT
ETag: "18b14059-2b-481d968347fc0"
Content-Length: 43

irb(main):001:0> 0x2b
=> 43
irb(main):002:0> Time.at(0x481d968347fc0).utc
=> Mon Mar 15 16:31:03 UTC 2010</code>

That said, the client does send the ETag with future requests on other accounts, so it is possible and would be kind of clever and explain why the image is there.
