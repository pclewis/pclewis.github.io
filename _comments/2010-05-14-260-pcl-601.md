<i>CDS itself</i> receives your name and IP address, it doesn't need a database of alts from Emerald or anywhere else.

In the test mentioned in the article, I got my alt banned by forging the request and went to the sim to check it out using Emerald. Then I returned on another alt using Emerald and was unaffected.
