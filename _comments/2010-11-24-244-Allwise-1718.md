This is awesome! 

Now I'd like to set up a webradio from my N900, so that I can play that stream from my HTPC that runs Ubuntu. I've got it to work with the internal microphone, but I can't really say that I get a party going from that. Now, I'd like to be able to stream either directly from the media player, or maybe from the system sound. I've tried some gstreamer commands but all I can get to stream is the test sine sound or the internal microphone, not the system sound. Any one got ideas?
