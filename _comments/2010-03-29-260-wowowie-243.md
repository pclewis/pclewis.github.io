I use modded Second Life viewer coz the regular SL viewer is so limiting. They are so paranoid about copybots that the honest builders and script writers gets punished too. INF has been cracking all the best viewers and handing out most of them for free, even though towards the end they cracked a very well renowned viewer SLPE and decided to sell that one instead, but others like neillife private 3.51, HXO, and Chocolate viewer are free. Love em, hate em, either way they are breaking barriers down for all.
